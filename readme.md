Possible use cases
------------------

* Rapid prototype your own builders without actually writing one
* Simple synchronisations (e.g., plugin version to POM artifact version)
* Not so simple synchronisations (e.g., keep "source" feature up-to-date with its corresponding "binary" feature, especially for tycho builds)
* Many more
